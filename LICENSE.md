## 2. Grant of License (Permitted Use)

You may use Journey freely if your Entity generates less than $10,000 USD in total monthly revenue.

For Entities generating at least $10,000 USD in total monthly revenue, each Project using Journey requires a separate commercial build key. Please purchase a build key: [https://gojourney.dev](https://gojourney.dev)

---

## 3. Commercial License Required

If your Entity generates at least $10,000 USD in total monthly revenue, you must obtain a separate commercial build key for each Project that uses Journey.

This includes internal business applications such as employee tools, operational systems, data processing applications, and administrative systems.

To purchase a commercial build key, please visit: [https://gojourney.dev](https://gojourney.dev)

If you believe your use of Journey requires a commercial license, you may continue using it for up to **30 days** while you evaluate licensing terms, without a build key or with a free "Small Project" build key. Continued use beyond this period without a valid commercial build key may violate this agreement.
